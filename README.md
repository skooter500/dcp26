## Week 9 - OOP

### Lab
# Lab Exercise: Object-Oriented Programming in Python

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lab, you will be able to:
- Create classes with attributes and methods
- Implement encapsulation using private attributes
- Use inheritance to create class hierarchies
- Demonstrate polymorphism through method overriding
- Build a complete object-oriented system

---

## Setup

Create a new Python file called `music_game.py` for this lab exercise.

---

## Part 1: Creating Basic Classes

### Task 1.1: Create a Musician Class

Create a `Musician` class with the following specifications:

- **Attributes:**
  - `name` (string)
  - `instrument` (string)
  - `skill_level` (integer, 1-10)

- **Methods:**
  - `__init__(self, name, instrument, skill_level)` - constructor
  - `play(self)` - returns a string: `"{name} plays the {instrument}"`
  - `practice(self)` - increases skill_level by 1 (max 10)
  - `get_info(self)` - returns a string with all musician details

**Test your code:**
```python
musician1 = Musician("Aoife", "fiddle", 7)
print(musician1.play())
print(musician1.get_info())
musician1.practice()
print(musician1.get_info())
```

**Expected output:**
```
Aoife plays the fiddle
Aoife plays fiddle at skill level 7
Aoife plays fiddle at skill level 8
```

---

## Part 2: Encapsulation

### Task 2.1: Create a Session Class

Irish traditional music sessions are gatherings where musicians play tunes together. Create a `Session` class with encapsulation:

- **Private Attributes:**
  - `__musicians` (list) - stores Musician objects
  - `__location` (string)
  - `__max_capacity` (integer)

- **Methods:**
  - `__init__(self, location, max_capacity)` - constructor
  - `add_musician(self, musician)` - adds a musician if under capacity
  - `remove_musician(self, name)` - removes a musician by name
  - `get_musician_count(self)` - returns number of musicians
  - `list_musicians(self)` - prints all musicians in the session
  - `get_location(self)` - returns the location

**Test your code:**
```python
session = Session("The Cobblestone", 5)
session.add_musician(musician1)
session.add_musician(Musician("Liam", "guitar", 6))
session.list_musicians()
print(f"Musicians in session: {session.get_musician_count()}")
```

---

## Part 3: Inheritance

### Task 3.1: Create Specialized Musician Classes

Create two subclasses of `Musician`:

**LeadMusician Class:**
- Inherits from `Musician`
- Additional attribute: `specialty` (string, e.g., "Irish reels")
- Override `play()` method to return: `"{name} leads the session with {specialty} on {instrument}"`
- Add new method `start_tune(self, tune_name)` that returns: `"{name} starts playing {tune_name}"`

**BeginnersMusician Class:**
- Inherits from `Musician`
- Additional attribute: `learning` (boolean, starts as True)
- Override `play()` method to return: `"{name} is learning to play the {instrument}"`
- Add method `graduate(self)` that sets `learning` to False and increases skill_level by 2

**Test your code:**
```python
lead = LeadMusician("Máire", "flute", 9, "slip jigs")
beginner = BeginnersMusician("Tom", "bodhrán", 3)

print(lead.play())
print(lead.start_tune("The Butterfly"))
print(beginner.play())
beginner.graduate()
print(f"{beginner.name} skill level: {beginner.skill_level}")
```

---

## Part 4: Polymorphism

### Task 4.1: Demonstrate Polymorphism

Create a function called `hold_session()` that accepts a list of any type of Musician object and:
1. Prints "--- Session Starting ---"
2. Calls the `play()` method on each musician
3. Prints "--- Session Ending ---"

**Test your code:**
```python
musicians = [
    Musician("Aoife", "fiddle", 7),
    LeadMusician("Máire", "flute", 9, "slip jigs"),
    BeginnersMusician("Tom", "bodhrán", 3)
]

hold_session(musicians)
```

**Expected output:**
```
--- Session Starting ---
Aoife plays the fiddle
Máire leads the session with slip jigs on flute
Tom is learning to play the bodhrán
--- Session Ending ---
```

Notice how the same method name `play()` produces different output depending on the object type!

---


Answer these questions in comments at the end of your file:

1. What advantages does encapsulation provide in the Session class?
2. How does inheritance help avoid code duplication between Musician classes?
3. Give an example of polymorphism from this lab and explain why it's useful.
4. What other real-world scenarios could you model using OOP?

---

## Tips

- Test each part as you go - don't wait until the end!
- Use descriptive variable names
- Remember to call `super().__init__()` in subclass constructors
- If you get stuck, refer back to the [lecture slides](week8-oop-python-1.pdf) & [example](week8/week8.py)

- [Lab Solution](week8/ace.py)

### Lab

# Ace Ventura Pet Detective Text Analysis

## Objective
Analyze the Ace Ventura screenplay excerpt to extract insights using Python lists, strings, and dictionaries.

## Dataset
You have been provided with a screenplay excerpt from "Ace Ventura: Pet Detective" saved as `aceventura.txt`.

---

**Clean the data**

Write a function `clean_word(word)` that:
- Converts words to lowercase
- Removes punctuation
- Returns the cleaned word
- See previous lab

```python
def clean_word(word):
    # Your code here
    pass
```

Load the file into a list of strings (previous lab)

**Count Word Frequencies**

Create a dictionary called `word_counts` that stores each word and how many times it appears in the script. Use your `clean_word()` function.

**Task 1.3: Find the Top 10 Most Common Words**

Write code to find and print the 10 most frequently used words and their counts.

To sort a dictionary by values:

```python
word_counts = {'hello': 5, 'world': 3, 'python': 8, 'data': 2}

# Get top 3 words

top_3 = sorted(word_counts.items(), key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)[:3]
```

key=lambda x: x[1] tells Python to sort by the second element (index 1) of each tuple, which is the count.
reverse=True sorts in descending order (highest first).

---

## Characters

**Extract Character Names**

Screenplay format puts character names in ALL CAPS before their dialogue. Write a function that identifies character names by:
- Looking for lines that are in all uppercase
- Filtering out common scene headings (EXT., INT., CONT'D, DAY, NIGHT, etc.)
- Storing unique character names in a list

```python
def extract_characters(lines):
    characters = []
    # Your code here
    return characters
```

**Task 2.2: Count Lines per Character**

Create a dictionary where:
- Keys are character names
- Values are the number of times that character speaks

**Task 2.3: Character Report**

Print a formatted report showing:
- Total number of unique characters
- Each character and their number of speaking lines
- The character with the most dialogue


**Task 3.2: Dialogue Length Analysis**

For each character, calculate:
- Total number of words spoken
- Average words per line of dialogue

Store this in a dictionary structure of your choice.

**Task 3.3: Word Usage by Character**

Create a nested dictionary that shows which words each character uses most frequently:
```python
character_words = {
    "UPS MAN": {"word1": count1, "word2": count2, ...},
    "GRUFF MAN": {"word1": count1, ...}
}
```

Bonus!

**Stop Words**

Common words like "the", "a", "is", "in" aren't very interesting. Create a list of stop words and modify your word frequency analysis to exclude them.

**Action vs Dialogue**

Screenplays have action descriptions (normal text) and dialogue (text after character names). Calculate what percentage of the script is dialogue versus action.

**Challenge 3: Character Interaction Matrix**

Create a dictionary that shows which characters appear in scenes together. This might look like:

```python
{
    "UPS MAN": ["GRUFF MAN"],
    "GRUFF MAN": ["UPS MAN"]
}
```

## Sample Output Format

```
=== WORD FREQUENCY ANALYSIS ===
Total unique words: XXX
Top 10 most common words:
1. the: XX occurrences
2. man: XX occurrences
...

=== CHARACTER ANALYSIS ===
Total characters: X
UPS MAN: XX lines
GRUFF MAN: XX lines
...

=== SCENE BREAKDOWN ===
Total scenes: X
EXT scenes: X
INT scenes: X
```

### Lab

# AI Shakespere

### Overview

Part 1
- Load the file shakespere.txt into a a list of Dictionaries, where each Dictionary has a key consisting of the roman numeral number of the sonnet and value of the 14 lines of the Sonnet
- Print the list in the form of roman numeral + first line of the sonnet

Part 2

Program DANI - Dynamic Artificial Non-Intelligence. An AI capable of many tasks, such as writing Poetry. Here are two examples of DANI's poems:

```
father let this in thee shall shine
identify do mine only care i ensconce
who calls thee releasing
fleeting year would have lookd on the
thine heir might have faculty by us
thrall
bed
liii
presence grace impiety
wane so suited and sun of hand
untrue
sending a united states who will believe
project gutenbergtm license apply to anyone in
nurseth the lease of compliance to identify

adding one most which the deathbed whereon
travel forth all away yourself in process
seen the wretch to complying with frost
being fond on men ride
whateer thy minds to occur a son
reported to prove me words respect
famine where i cannot contain a bastard
thorns did exceed
effectually is had stoln of year thou
treasure of skill and unfatherd fruit
liii
5000 are restord and distribution of hearsay
ill well esteemd
stole that fair friend for through 1e7
```

DANI works, by loading a text and storing a list of each word from the document in an Dictionary. The key is the word itself and the value is a list, where each element is the word following. This is called the "model". 

For example, for this input file:

```
i love Star Trek
love is love
I love TU Dublin 
```

DANI will generate the following model:


```
i: love 
love: star is tu 
star: trek
trek:
is: love
tu: dublin
dublin:
```

Each word is listed once in the model, regardless of how many times it occurs in the document. Each word is printed and all of the words that follow the word in the text. In the above example, the words star is and tu follow the word love. The word i is followed by the word love.

To write a poem, DANI picks one word at random from the model and starts with that. Then DANI looks to see what possible words will follow the chosen word and it picks one at random from the list for the next word. It then repeats the process until it has 8 words, or until it finds a word that has nothing following it - in which case it will terminate the sentence. It does this 14 times to write a poem as there are 14 lines in a sonnet.

To get a random key from a dictionary:

```
import random

my_dict = {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3, 'd': 4}
random_key = random.choice(list(my_dict.keys()))
print(random_key)
```

Train DANI on the shakespere sonnets and create the program to write the poem

Extra!

Try and incorporate the frequency of word following into the model and poem generation

Congrations you have created an N-Gram 1 language model :-) N-Gram 5 or 6 was State of the Art before LLMs

### Lab

# ABC Music File Parser Lab
## Parsing Irish Traditional Music in ABC Notation

**Dataset:** ABC notation file with 200+ Irish traditional tunes

---

## Overview

You'll parse an ABC music notation file, extract tune information, and analyze it with pandas. ABC notation is a text-based music format where each tune has metadata (title, key, type) and the musical notation.

---

## Part 1: Understanding the File Format

### Task 1.1: Examine the File Structure

Open the ABC file and look at a few tunes. Each tune follows this pattern:

```
X:21001 
T:FUNNY TAILOR, The
R:jig 
M:6/8
L:1/8
K:G
BA|GED GAB|GBA G2G|...

%%%

X:21002 
T:BUNKER HILL (reel)
R:reel
K:G
...
```

**Key observations:**
- Every tune starts with `X:` followed by a number
- `T:` lines contain the title (can have multiple T: lines - first is main title, second is alternate)
- `R:` is the tune type (reel, jig, hornpipe, slip jig, etc.)
- `K:` is the musical key (G, D, Em, Dmaj, etc.)
- Tunes end with blank lines (often marked with `%%%`)
- Everything from X: to the blank lines is the "notation"

**Questions to answer:**
1. How can you identify when a new tune starts?
2. How can you identify when a tune ends?
3. What information do we need to extract?

---

## Part 2: Read File into a List

### Task 2.1: Load the File

Write code to read the ABC file line by line into a list.

**Hints:**
- Use `open()` with the file path
- Read all lines at once or iterate line by line
- Each line will be a string


### Task 2.2: Inspect the Data

After loading:
- Print the total number of lines
- Print the first 20 lines to see the structure
- Print the last 10 lines

**Questions:**
- How many lines are in the file?
- Can you spot where tunes begin and end?

---

## Part 3: Parse Tunes into Dictionaries

This is the main challenge! You need to:
1. Identify tune boundaries (starts with X:, ends with blank lines)
2. Extract metadata from each tune
3. Store each tune as a dictionary

### Task 3.1: Find Tune Boundaries

Write code to identify where each tune starts and ends.

**Approach:**
- Loop through all lines
- When you see a line starting with "X:", that's a new tune
- Collect lines until you hit blank lines
- A blank line is when `line.strip() == ""`

**Hint for structure:**
```python
tunes = []
current_tune_lines = []
in_tune = False

for line in lines:
    # Check if this starts a new tune
    if line.startswith("X:"):
        # If we were already collecting a tune, save it first
        if current_tune_lines:
            # Process the previous tune
            pass
        # Start collecting new tune
        current_tune_lines = [line]
        in_tune = True
    elif in_tune:
        # Keep collecting lines for current tune
        # Check if blank line (end of tune)
        pass
```

### Task 3.2: Extract Tune Metadata

For each tune, extract:
- **X:** The tune ID (just the number part)
- **T:** Title (first T: line you encounter)
- **Alt Title:** Second T: line (if it exists)
- **R:** Tune type (the text after R:)
- **K:** Key (the text after K:)
- **Notation:** All lines from X: to end (as a single string)

**Parsing hints:**
```python
def parse_tune(tune_lines):
    """Parse a list of lines into a tune dictionary"""
    tune = {
        'X': None,
        'title': None,
        'alt_title': None,
        'tune_type': None,
        'key': None,
        'notation': '\n'.join(tune_lines)
    }
    
    # Put your code here!
    
    return tune
```
### Task 3.3: Build the Complete Tune List

Combine Tasks 3.1 and 3.2 to create a list of tune dictionaries.

**Test your code:**
```python
print(f"Found {len(tunes)} tunes")
print("\nFirst tune:")
print(tunes[0])
print("\nLast tune:")
print(tunes[-1])
```

**Expected output structure:**
```python
{
    'X': '21001',
    'title': 'FUNNY TAILOR, The',
    'alt_title': None,
    'tune_type': 'jig',
    'key': 'G',
    'notation': 'X:21001\nT:FUNNY TAILOR...'
}
```

---

## Part 4: Load into Pandas DataFrame

### Task 4.1: Create DataFrame

Convert your list of dictionaries into a pandas DataFrame.

```python
import pandas as pd

# Your code here
```

### Task 4.2: Inspect the DataFrame

```python
# Print basic info
print(df.shape)
print(df.head())
print(df.info())

# Check for missing values
print(df.isnull().sum())

# What columns do we have?
print(df.columns)
```

**Questions:**
- How many tunes were successfully parsed?
- How many have alternate titles?
- What data type is each column?

---

## Part 5: Data Analysis Queries

Now the fun part - analyze the tunes!

### Task 5.1: Group by Tune Type

Count how many tunes of each type (reel, jig, hornpipe, etc.)

```python
# Your code here - use value_counts() or groupby()
```

**Questions:**
- Which tune type is most common?
- Which tune type is least common?
- How many different tune types are there?

### Task 5.2: Group by Key

Count how many tunes in each musical key.

```python
# Your code here
```

**Questions:**
- Which key is most popular?
- Are there more tunes in major or minor keys?
- Any unusual keys?

### Task 5.3: Find Alcoholic Drinks in Titles

Search for tunes that mention alcoholic drinks in their titles.

**Common alcoholic drinks to search for:**
- whiskey/whisky
- beer/ale
- wine
- brandy
- punch
- porter
- rum
- gin

**Hints:**
- Use `.str.contains()` with `case=False` and `na=False`
- Can search for multiple terms using `|` (OR operator)
- Example: `df['title'].str.contains('whiskey|brandy', case=False, na=False)`

```python
# Your code here
```

**Questions:**
- How many tunes mention alcoholic drinks?
- Which drink appears most often?
- Print the titles of these tunes

### Task 6.4: Export Results

Save your DataFrame to a CSV file:

```python
df.to_csv('parsed_tunes.csv', index=False)
```

---

## Tips for Success

### Common Issues

## Week 4 - Explore the Tunepal dataset with Pandas

- [Slides](pandas.pdf)

### Lab 

# Irish Music Albums Lab
## Exploring Album and Track Data with Pandas

**Duration:** 2 hours  
**Dataset:** Irish traditional music albums and tracks from thesession.org

---

## Setup

Create a new Python file called `albums_lab.py` and load the two CSV files:
- `album.csv` - Contains album information
- `albumtracktune.csv` - Contains tracks and tunes on each album

**Hint:** Look at the class example for how to load CSV files with pandas.

---

## Part 1: Explore the Albums (20 minutes)

### Task 1.1: Load and Inspect Albums
Load `album.csv` and answer these questions:
- How many albums are in the dataset?
- What are the column names?
- Which artists appear in the first 5 albums?
- Which artists appear in the last 5 albums?

**Hint:** Use `head()`, `tail()`, `shape`, and `info()`

### Task 1.2: Data Types
- What data type is each column?
- Are there any missing values?

**Hint:** Use `info()` and `describe()`

### Task 1.3: Unique Values
Find out:
- How many unique artists are in the dataset?
- Who are the artists?

**Hint:** Look up how to get unique values from a pandas column

---

## Part 2: Explore the Tracks (20 minutes)

### Task 2.1: Load and Inspect Tracks
Load `albumtracktune.csv` and answer:
- How many tracks are in the dataset?
- What columns does this dataset have?
- What is the relationship between this file and the albums file?

**Hint:** Notice the `album_id` column - what does it refer to?

### Task 2.2: Track Numbers
- What's the highest track number on any album?
- How many tunes can a single track contain?

**Hint:** Look at the `track_num` and `tune_num` columns

### Task 2.3: Common Tune Titles
Which tune titles appear most frequently across all albums?

**Hint:** Use `value_counts()` like in the class example

---

## Part 3: Filtering and Counting

### Task 3.1: Albums by Artist
Filter the albums to show only:
1. Albums by "Altan"
2. Albums by "Martin Hayes"
3. Albums by "The Bothy Band"

How many albums does each artist have in the dataset?

**Hint:** Use boolean indexing like `df[df['column'] == 'value']`

### Task 3.2: Tracks on Specific Albums
1. Find all tracks on album_id 1 (Martin Hayes - The Lonesome Touch)
2. How many tracks are on this album?
3. How many total tunes are on this album?

**Hint:** Filter the tracks dataframe by `album_id`

### Task 3.3: Multi-Tune Tracks
Find all tracks that have more than one tune (tune_num > 1)

How many such tracks are there?

**Hint:** Boolean filtering on the `tune_num` column

---

## Part 4: Grouping and Aggregating

### Task 4.1: Tracks per Album
Group the tracks by `album_id` and count how many tracks each album has.

Which album has the most tracks?

**Hint:** Use `groupby()` and `count()` or `size()`

### Task 4.2: Tunes per Album
For each album, calculate the total number of tunes (not just tracks - remember some tracks have multiple tunes!)

**Hint:** You might need to count all rows for each album_id

### Task 4.3: Average Tunes per Track
Calculate the average number of tunes per track for each album.

Which albums tend to have more tunes per track?

**Hint:** Use `groupby()` with `mean()` on the `tune_num` column

---

## Part 5: Sorting

### Task 5.1: Sort Albums
Sort the albums:
1. Alphabetically by title
2. Alphabetically by artist
3. By ID in descending order

**Hint:** Use `sort_values()` with the `ascending` parameter

### Task 5.2: Sort Tracks
Sort the tracks dataframe:
1. By album_id, then by track_num
2. By title alphabetically

**Hint:** You can pass a list of column names to `sort_values()`

---

## Part 6: Merging the Datasets (30 minutes)

Now it's time to combine the two datasets!

### Task 6.1: Simple Merge
Merge the albums and tracks dataframes together so you can see the artist and album title alongside each track.

**Hint:** Look up `pd.merge()` - you'll need to specify which columns to join on. The common column between the two dataframes is the album ID (but it has different names in each dataframe!)

### Task 6.2: Explore the Merged Data
After merging, answer:
- How many rows does the merged dataframe have?
- What new information can you see now that the data is merged?
- Print the first 10 rows

### Task 6.3: Questions with Merged Data
Now that you have both album info and track info together, answer:

1. How many tracks does Martin Hayes have across all his albums?
2. What tunes appear on Altan albums?
3. Which artist has the most individual tune entries in the dataset?

**Hint:** After merging, you can filter by artist name and count

## Part 7: Advanced Exploration

### Task 7.1: Most Prolific Artists
Create a summary showing:
- Each artist
- Number of albums they have
- Total number of tracks across all their albums
- Total number of tunes across all their albums

**Hint:** You'll need to use the merged dataframe and `groupby()` with aggregation

### Task 7.2: Find Repeated Tunes
Some tune titles appear on multiple albums. Find:
1. Which tune title appears most frequently across different albums?
2. Which artists have recorded this tune?

**Hint:** Use `value_counts()` on tune titles, then filter to find those albums

### Task 7.3: Album Completeness
For each album, show:
- Album title
- Artist
- Number of tracks
- Whether all track numbers are sequential (no gaps)

**Hint:** Think about what "sequential" means - track 1, 2, 3, 4... with no missing numbers

---

## Bonus Challenges (If Time Permits)

### Bonus 1: Custom Print Function
Write a function that prints album information nicely formatted:
```
Album: [title]
Artist: [artist]
Tracks: [number]
Tunes: [number]
```

### Bonus 2: Track Listings
Create a function that takes an album_id and prints a complete track listing:
```
Album: The Lonesome Touch by Martin Hayes

Track 1:
  1. Paddy Fahy's
Track 2:
  1. The Kerfunten
Track 3:
  1. Paul Ha'penny
  2. The Garden Of Butterflies
  3. The Broken Pledge
  ...
```

### Bonus 3: Artist Comparison
Compare two artists of your choice:
- How many albums does each have?
- Total tracks?
- Total tunes?
- Do they share any tune titles?

**Hint:** Filter merged data for each artist, then compare

## Common Pandas Operations You'll Need

Here's a quick reference:

```python
# Loading
df = pd.read_csv("filename.csv")

# Exploring
df.head()
df.tail()
df.shape
df.info()
df.describe()

# Accessing columns
df['column_name']
df[['col1', 'col2']]

# Filtering
df[df['column'] == value]
df[df['column'] > value]
df[(condition1) & (condition2)]

# Counting
df['column'].value_counts()
df['column'].nunique()

# Grouping
df.groupby('column').count()
df.groupby('column').sum()
df.groupby('column').mean()

# Sorting
df.sort_values('column')
df.sort_values('column', ascending=False)
df.sort_values(['col1', 'col2'])

# Merging
pd.merge(df1, df2, left_on='col1', right_on='col2')
```

## Reflection Questions

At the end of the lab, consider:

1. What did you learn about Irish traditional music from this data?
2. What patterns did you notice in how albums are structured?
3. What was the most challenging part of working with these datasets?
4. How did merging the datasets help answer questions you couldn't answer before?
5. What other questions would you like to explore with this data?

---

## Extension Ideas

If you finish early or want to explore further:

- Find albums that share the most tune titles
- Calculate average album length (in tracks) by artist
- Identify "set tunes" - tunes that always appear together on tracks
- Create visualizations of the data
- Export your findings to a new CSV file

---

## What to Submit

Save your Python file with:
- All your code for the tasks
- Comments explaining what each section does
- At least one interesting finding you discovered


## Week 3 - Pandas

### Lab - StarMap Lab - Pandas with py5

[![Video](http://img.youtube.com/vi/J2kHSSFA4NU/0.jpg)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2kHSSFA4NU)


## Overview

Create an interactive 3D star map visualization using py5 and pandas. You'll load real star data, plot it on a grid, and create interactive features to explore nearby stars.

---

## Task 1: Load the Data

Use pandas to load the `HabHYG15ly.csv` file. This file contains data on stars within 15 light years of the sun.

### Columns of Interest

| Column | Name | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| Hab? | Habitability flag | 1 = high probability of habitable planet |
| Display Name | Star name | The name of the star |
| Distance | Distance | Distance from the sun in parsecs |
| Xg, Yg, Zg | Coordinates | XYZ galactic cartesian coordinates in parsecs |
| AbsMag | Magnitude | Star's absolute magnitude (brightness/size) |

### Your Tasks
1. Write a `load_data()` function that loads the CSV with correct encoding
2. Call it from `setup()` and store the DataFrame globally
3. Print the number of stars loaded


## Task 2: Explore the Data

Write a `print_stars()` function that prints useful information about the stars:
- Total number of stars
- First 5 stars with their names, distances, and coordinates
- Any other interesting statistics you find

## Task 3: Draw the Grid

Create a coordinate grid for your star map:

**Requirements:**
- 50 pixel border around the edge
- Grid from -5 to 5 parsecs on both X and Y axes
- Purple gridlines every 1 parsec
- Label each gridline with its parsec value

**Coordinate Conversion:**

```python
py5.remap(parsecs, -5, 5, border, py5.width - border)
```

## Task 4: Plot the Stars

For each star, draw:

1. **Yellow cross** at the star's position (Xg, Yg)
   - About 10 pixels in size
   
2. **Red circle** with diameter based on AbsMag
   - Use `no_fill()` for hollow circles
   - Scale magnitude appropriately (experiment with sizing)

3. **Star name** beside the star
   - Left aligned, vertically centered


## Task 5: Interactive Features

Add mouse interaction to explore star distances.

**Behavior:**
1. **First click:** Select a star, draw yellow line from star to mouse cursor
2. **Second click:** Select another star, draw line between them, display distance

**Display format:**
```
Distance from [STAR1] to [STAR2] is [XX.XX] parsecs
```

**Hints:**
- Use global variables to track selected stars
- Use 3D distance formula: √(dx² + dy² + dz²)
- Check if mouse is within a star's circle radius

    py5.background(0)
    draw_grid()
    draw_stars()
    # Add interactive line drawing here

def mouse_pressed():
    """Handle mouse clicks"""
    # Your code here
    pass

py5.run_sketch()
```

---

## Extension Ideas

Once you complete the basic tasks, try:

1. **Color by habitability:** Make habitable stars (Hab? = 1) a different color
2. **Size by distance:** Scale star circles based on distance from Sol
3. **Filter view:** Add keyboard controls to show only certain star types
4. **3D visualization:** Use py5's 3D mode to plot Zg as well
5. **Star info panel:** Display detailed info when hovering over a star
6. **Constellation lines:** Connect related stars

---

## Tips

- Test each task individually before moving to the next
- Use print statements to debug coordinate conversions
- The sun (Sol) should appear at the center (0,0)
- Experiment with scaling factors to make visualization clear
- Use `py5.dist()` for distance calculations in pixel space
- Use the math formula for parsec space distances
